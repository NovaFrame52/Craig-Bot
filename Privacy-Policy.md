# Privacy Policy for Craig Discord Bot

**Last Updated: February 7, 2026**

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the Craig Discord bot ("Craig", "the Bot", "we", "us") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our service. We are committed to transparency about our data practices.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Automatically Collected Information

When Craig operates in your Discord server, the Bot automatically collects:

- **Message Content**: The text of messages that trigger responses or mention the Bot (used only for determining whether to respond)
- **User Information**: Discord username and user ID of users who interact with the Bot
- **Channel Information**: Channel ID where interactions occur
- **Server Information**: Server/guild ID where the Bot is installed
- **Timestamps**: When interactions occur

### 2.2 Log Data

Craig maintains logs for debugging and operational purposes, which may include:

- Message triggers and Bot responses
- Slash command usage
- Error messages and exceptions
- Timestamps of events
- User IDs and channel IDs

### 2.3 Information We Do NOT Collect

Craig does not collect, store, or process:

- Message content from messages that don't trigger the Bot
- Private or direct messages
- User email addresses or personal contact information
- Voice chat data
- Attachments or media files
- Messages in channels where the Bot is not present
- Data from users who don't interact with the Bot

## 3. How We Use Information

We use collected information solely for the following purposes:

- **Bot Operation**: To detect trigger phrases and determine when to respond
- **Slash Commands**: To execute user-requested commands
- **Logging**: To debug issues, monitor performance, and improve the Bot
- **Analytics**: To understand usage patterns (locally, not shared with third parties)

## 4. Data Storage and Retention

### 4.1 Storage Location

- Log files are stored locally on the server where Craig is deployed
- No data is transmitted to external servers or third-party services (except Discord's API)
- Data is not stored in cloud databases or external analytics platforms

### 4.2 Retention Period

- **Active Logs**: Retained according to the server administrator's configuration
- **Historical Data**: Log files may be rotated or deleted based on local server configuration
- **No Permanent Storage**: We do not maintain long-term databases of user interactions

### 4.3 Data Deletion

Server administrators can delete log files at any time. Removing Craig from a server immediately stops all data collection from that server.

## 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

### 5.1 Third-Party Sharing

We do NOT sell, trade, rent, or share your data with third parties for marketing or any other purposes.

### 5.2 Discord Platform

Craig uses Discord's API to function and necessarily shares data with Discord according to Discord's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. This includes:

- Message content the Bot reads (as permitted by Discord's Message Content Intent)
- Responses the Bot sends
- Slash command interactions

### 5.3 Legal Requirements

We may disclose information if required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process.

## 6. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect collected data:

- Log files are stored with restricted file system permissions
- Access to the server is limited to authorized administrators
- The Bot runs under a dedicated system user account with limited privileges

However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

### 7.1 Server Administrators

Server administrators who host Craig can:

- View and delete log files at any time
- Configure the Bot's response behavior
- Remove the Bot entirely to stop all data collection
- Access the source code to verify data handling practices

### 7.2 End Users

Discord users can:

- Avoid triggering the Bot by not using trigger phrases
- Request that server administrators remove the Bot
- Leave servers where Craig is present

### 7.3 Data Access and Deletion

To request information about data we've collected about you, or to request deletion:

- Contact your server administrator for log file access
- Server administrators can delete log files directly
- Removing the Bot from a server stops all future data collection

## 8. Children's Privacy

Craig does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). The Bot relies on Discord's age verification. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us.

## 9. Open Source Transparency

Craig is open source software. You can review the complete source code to verify:

- What data is collected
